# Information
With this userscript, you can import your favourites from Bierdopje.com to Seriesfeed.com.<BR />
Your username will be filled in automatically if you are logged onto Bierdopje.com. You can use any username you like, however. After clicking the Import button, your favourites are being imported into Seriesfeed. In the Details table, rows are being given a colour if there is something about that series. Blue rows will indicate you most likely already have that series as a favourite on Seriesfeed. Yellow ones indicate the series does not exist on Seriesfeed yet and red ones indicate that an error has happened while connecting Bierdopje or Seriesfeed. You can always try again to see if it works the second time.

# Development
If you want to help with the development, you can. From now on I'll be working in the `src/Seriesfeed-Importer-TS` directory, in which a TypeScript project is located. You can use this for development. To setup the dev in combination with Tampermonkey/other, do the following:
- Open the `src/Seriesfeed-Importer-TS` folder in Visual Studio Code.
- Open the terminal using CTRL + `
- Type: `tsc --watch` to run the TypeScript compiler. The `tsconfig.json` file will determine the location of the output.
- Add a userscript and add `// @require   YOUR_CLONE_LOCATION/src/Seriesfeed-Importer-TS/SeriesfeedImport.user.js`

Any change will compile (some would say transpile) and a browser refresh will do the rest.
